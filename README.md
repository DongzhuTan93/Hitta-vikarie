## Introduction to the CRUD Application

"Hitta vikarie" is a web application built with React.js and Javascript that aims to create an efficient and user-friendly communication platform for employers and job seekers. 

Through the website, job seekers can create an account, provide their contact details, detail their work experience and indicate their available working hours. Similarly, employers can register and access a list of available job seekers for a period of time. This enables employers to effectively screen and contact suitable candidates.
